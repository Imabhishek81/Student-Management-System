Student Report System is a Java-based menu-driven console application that manages student records efficiently.
It is built using Core Java, OOP principles, and Java Collections Framework (ArrayList) to perform operations like Add Student, Display Students, Search Student, and calculate Total Marks, Percentage, and Grade.
The project implements Exception Handling for safe user input and uses File Handling to store student data in a file (save and load records), ensuring data persistence even after program termination.
